//! `TODO/podvm.md` T-1301: the machine tier as legs, and the refusal rule.
//!
//! One leg per fact the tier needs, each measured, never inferred from
//! another leg. The legs run as [`crate::probes`] rows in
//! [`crate::probes::Group::Machine`] order; this module reads their
//! verdicts back through [`crate::probes::MACHINE_LEGS`], so a rename moves
//! the rows, the constant and this assessment together.
//!
//! The assessment establishes a profile, not just a refusal. `full` needs
//! every leg plus `kvm` in the emulator's own accelerator list; `tcg`
//! needs the emulator, `tcg` in that list, the file-size bound and image
//! space, with kvm and tun reported but not blocking. A TCG boundary is
//! the emulator process, never hardware isolation, and the banner says
//! so. Refusal stays only where no profile holds: no usable accelerator
//! at all, or no space, or the emulator missing.
//!
//! ⛔ A row that is absent is a missing leg, not a passing one. A document
//! written before the legs existed carries no verdict for them, and reading
//! that absence as anything but missing would be the silent non-isolation
//! T-1301 exists to refuse.
