//! `experiments/251-tty-refusal-no-ptmx.sh` as an integration test.
//!
//! `run -t` refuses by name where /dev/ptmx is unusable, with the exit
//! code from the process that produced it. The gate reads only
//! `podbox_probe::probes::ptmx_usable`: an Ok open row promises a pty and
//! anything else refuses. Two halves. The first always runs: synthetic
//! findings prove both arms, usable promises and unusable refuses,
//! including that existence is not function. The second arranges a machine
//! with no usable ptmx, a private mount namespace where a fresh tmpfs
//! covers the pty path, and drives the trigger there. The refusal triggers
//! only with no ptmx, and the lane has a usable /dev/ptmx, so where the
//! cover cannot be arranged the drive reports SKIP with its reason and
//! passes, which is the script exit-2 contract. No live engine, no mounts
//! outside a self-created user and mount namespace.
