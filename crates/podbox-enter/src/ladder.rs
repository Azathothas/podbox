//! [`TODO/packaging.md`](../../../TODO/packaging.md) T-1003: the launch ladder,
//! and the order it is tried in.
//!
//! memfd, then FUSE, then an ephemeral tmpfs, then a private run directory,
//! then a persistent cache: the onelf shape
//! (`references/qaidvoid__onelf/tree/crates/onelf-rt/src/main.rs:125-131`),
//! shortened where this runtime refuses a rung by probe rather than omitting
//! it. Each **forced** mode refuses with a named reason rather than falling
//! through, copying that file's `:216-218`, `:235-237` and `:255-257`.
//!
//! ⭐ **Rung-complete is the memfd rung; the rest is sketched.** The memfd
//! driver ([`crate::memfd`]) writes bytes, seals where accepted, and execs the
//! fd. FUSE and tmpfs are probe inputs: this module orders them and refuses
//! them by name, and `podbox-probe` measures them. The run-dir and cache rungs
//! need extraction the CLI does not wire yet, so they answer "not implemented"
//! until it does. The single file with an embedded rootfs is a follow-up the
//! entry names, not a rung built here.
//!
//! ⚠ This module orders and refuses; it never measures. What the machine
//! permits arrives as [`Availability`], read by the caller from the probe, so
//! every decision below is a pure function unit tests drive.
