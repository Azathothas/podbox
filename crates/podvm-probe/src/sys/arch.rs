// ------------------------------------------------- stat, which has three names
//
// ⛔ **The same syscall is called three different things by the kernel, and on
// two architectures it writes a different struct.** Measured against the
// kernel's own tables on 2026-09-09:
//
//   newfstatat + struct stat     x86_64, riscv64, powerpc64, s390x
//   fstatat    + struct stat     aarch64, loongarch64
//   fstatat64  + struct stat64   arm, x86        (32-bit: `stat` is the narrow
//                                                 form and would truncate)
//
// ⚠ The pairing is the point. Taking `fstatat64`'s number with `struct stat`'s
// buffer is a kernel write of the wrong shape into the right-sized hole, which
// is silent. The type and the number move together here so they cannot drift.

// -------------------------------------------- the three that ARE the question

// three the entry point is not an implementation detail: it is what the row
// says was asked. On an architecture whose kernel has no `chown(2)` the honest
// answer is not to quietly call `fchownat(2)` and print `chown`, it is to call
// what exists and SAY which, which is what [`Entry`] carries into the report.

/// architecture actually has for it.
