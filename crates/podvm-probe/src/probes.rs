//! The probe set, ported from `TOOL.md` section 6.1's minimum set and from the
//! Go instrument that implements it,
//! `references/Azathothas__container-research/tree/verification/probe/main.go`
//! and `.../probe/attribute.go`.
//!
//! ⭐ Row names are the reference's, character for character, so a podvm run
//! and a `probe census` / `probe attribute` run diff against each other. The
//! milestone's acceptance ([`TODO/milestones.md`](../../../TODO/milestones.md)
//! T-1101) is exactly that comparison.
//!
//! Four divergences from the Go instrument, each deliberate and each a defect
//! in it rather than a difference of taste:
//!
//! 1. ⛔ **The bare `mount(MS_SLAVE,/)` row is not ported.** In the caller's
//!    mount namespace it changes the propagation of `/` and everything under
//!    it, for the machine, permanently. `TOOL.md` section 6.1's minimum set
//!    names `mount(tmpfs)` in the current namespace and inside
//!    `clone(CLONE_NEWNS)`; it does not name that one. The `MS_SLAVE`
//!    operation is still measured, inside a private mount namespace where it
//!    cannot escape, which is also where bubblewrap performs it
//!    (`references/containers__bubblewrap/tree/bubblewrap.c:3257-3258`).
//! 2. **A probe that mounts, unmounts.** `mount(tmpfs,/mnt)` and
//!    `move_mount(-> /tmp/mm-probe)` succeed on an unconfined host, and the Go
//!    instrument leaves both mounted. A failure to remove one is reported in
//!    the row rather than left silent.
//! 3. **Nothing is overwritten.** Every scratch file is created `O_EXCL`, and
//!    an existing file at that path is a `skip` naming the file, not a probe
//!    that deletes somebody's data to make room for itself.
//! 4. ⭐ **A failed precondition is a `skip`, never the row's denial.** Where
//!    `fsmount` fails, the Go instrument reports its errno as
//!    `move_mount`'s verdict. `TODO/probe.md` T-0109 is that this is a defect:
//!    move_mount was not measured, so no verdict about it was established.
