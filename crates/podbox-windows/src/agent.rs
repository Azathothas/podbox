//! The guest side: two `cmd.exe` scripts and the mailbox file protocol.
//! `TODO/milestones.md` T-1112.
//!
//! ⛔ **The guest is `cmd.exe` and nothing else.** There is no cross-compiled
//! Windows agent to install, no driver to sign and no binary the host has to
//! trust the guest to run: the whole guest side is the two scripts below,
//! which `cmd.exe` already knows how to execute. That is what makes the
//! driver portable — it needs a Windows image, not a toolchain.
//!
//! ⛔ **Autostart is a scheduled task, and the two mechanisms that look more
//! obvious do not work on the reference image.** `cmd.exe`'s `AutoRun`
//! registry value does not fire for the shell Validation OS starts, and
//! neither does a `Run`/`RunOnce` value, because that logon does not go
//! through `userinit.exe`'s `Run` processing. An `onstart` scheduled task as
//! `SYSTEM` does fire, so that is what [`setup_cmd`] registers.
//!
//! ⚠ **A Windows *service* was tried and refused.** `sc create` with a
//! `cmd.exe` image starts the script and then the service control manager
//! terminates it once the process fails to report `SERVICE_RUNNING` — which
//! `cmd.exe` never does — and the termination lands mid-command. Raising
//! `ServicesPipeTimeout` did not save it. The task does not have that
//! problem, so the driver does not have that code.
//!
//! ⚠ **The token is deleted *after* the result is written.** A run killed
//! between the two re-runs the command on the next attempt rather than
//! losing it, which is the failure the reference protocol has.
