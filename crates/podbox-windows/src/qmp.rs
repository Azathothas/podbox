//! The emulator's monitor, spoken as QMP. `TODO/milestones.md` T-1112.
//!
//! ⛔ **QMP rather than HMP, and the reason is that HMP is a debug console.**
//! The human monitor's `sendkey` works, and the first revision of this
//! driver used it, but its syntax is not an interface: it is line-oriented
//! text with no error reporting beyond a printed string, and a call that
//! fails looks exactly like a call that worked. QMP is the documented one:
//! requests are JSON, every request has a response, and a refusal is a
//! `"error"` member rather than a sentence on a console nobody reads.
//!
//! ⚠ **No JSON dependency is taken for this.** The driver sends three
//! requests ever — `qmp_capabilities`, `send-key` and `quit` — with key
//! names drawn from a fixed table, so the request bodies are built by
//! formatting and the responses are read for the presence of `"error"`.
//! A JSON parser would be a dependency bought to inspect three strings,
//! and the strings it would inspect come from a closed set this file
//! already owns. What that costs is stated: an error object that
//! `response_ok` did not recognise would read as success, which is why the
//! only requests sent are ones whose refusal would also be visible as the
//! guest not doing the thing.
//!
//! ⚠ **The monitor socket is a way into the guest.** A local user who can
//! connect to it can type into the console, so the per-run directory that
//! holds it is created mode 0700 and the socket is inside that directory.
