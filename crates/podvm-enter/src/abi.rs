//! [`TODO/interpose.md`](../../../TODO/interpose.md) T-0709: choose the
//! interposer by `DT_NEEDED`, and refuse on the version predicate.
//!
//! ⭐ **A READER, and nothing here is executed to find anything out.** T-0702
//! establishes that one object per libc is required. Which object a payload
//! gets is then answered by `readelf`-level facts, and answering it instead by
//! loading one and seeing what happens costs a failed container and produces an
//! error naming a symbol, which sends the reader to debug the symbol rather
//! than the mechanism.
//!
//! Four facts, all of them measured by `experiments/80-interposer-abi.sh` and
//! recorded in `experiments/results/interposer-abi.txt`:
//!
//! 1. **the SONAME discriminator.** glibc's libc declares SONAME `libc.so.6`;
//!    musl's declares none, so an object linked against it records `libc.so` in
//!    `DT_NEEDED`. ⛔ There is no ambiguity and no heuristic;
//! 2. **the cross-libc arms**, in both directions: a glibc object in a musl
//!    payload is `__snprintf_chk: symbol not found`, and a musl object in a
//!    glibc payload is `libc.so: invalid ELF header`, because on a glibc host
//!    that name is a linker script;
//! 3. **the version predicate**, predicted from ELF and then confirmed by the
//!    loader: the object imported up to `GLIBC_2.34`, the payload libc declared
//!    up to `GLIBC_2.31`, the prediction was `refused`, and the loader said
//!    `version 'GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by /i.so)`;
//! 4. ⛔ **the trap that makes a naive reader refuse everything.** A shipped
//!    `libc.so.6` is stripped: on this host `.symtab` has **0** defined symbols
//!    and `.dynsym` has **3136**. A reader asking `.symtab` concludes the
//!    payload's libc defines nothing, refuses every artefact, and reads exactly
//!    like a check that works. [`Elf::defined`] reads `.dynsym` and this module
//!    never looks at `.symtab` at all.
//!
//! ⚠ **The libc is FOUND rather than named.** There is no table of
//! `lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6` here: the payload's own `PT_INTERP` says
//! which loader will run it, and for musl that file IS the libc while for glibc
//! the libc sits in the loader's own directory. A table would be a list of the
//! distributions somebody thought of.
